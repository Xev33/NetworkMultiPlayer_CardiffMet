### Project summary ###
The project has been in 2 weeks for the CIS6016 - MULTI-PLAYER GAME DEVELOPMENT module at Cardiff Metropolitan University during the year I spent there.
The goal was to create a small copy of the classic **Rally-X** arcade game (originally produced by Midway).
To do so, I had to take the module leader's repository in order to work with his UDP server's library and manipulate it to create an online multi player game.

### Academic assessment ###

The project has been submitted alongside with a Network performance report documentation.
